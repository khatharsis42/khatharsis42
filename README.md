Hi ! I'm Khâtharsis, real name Hadrien Guelque.
Currently studying at TélécomSudParis Engineering School, I'd like to work in software engineering.
I used to code in Python, but now I'm mostly about Kotlin, sometimes Java. Trying to get into C and Rust.
Head of teaching at my local coding student association, I'm the one creating most of the formations.
