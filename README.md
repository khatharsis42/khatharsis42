# Bio
Hi ! I'm Catherine, aka Khâtharsis.
Currently a PhD student at Télécom - SudParis Engineering School in the Benagil research team, I'm developing a [new trace format for exascale computing](https://github.com/trahay/Hierarchical-Trace-Format).
I'd probably like to work in software engineering after that. You can check out my website [here](http://wiki.khatharsis.com).

# Languages
I used to code a lot in Python, but my true love is Kotlin (and I am thus forced to somewhat like Java).

I have a love/hate relationship with C, in that it loves me but I hate it. My PhD is currently in C++. I'll get into Rust someday.

I have academic experience with Middleware tech in Java, High Performance computing with CUDA, OMP and MPI in C.

# Experience
Former head of teaching at my local coding student association, I was the one making most of the formations on various subjects, from Introduction to CS and Programming to Multithreading, Graph Theory and Cellular Automata. You can find the slides and the practicals I did over there on [here](https://khatharsis.com/club-code-archive/).

I've been participating in Advent of Code each year since 2020. Here's where you can find my code for each year:
 - 2020 (unavailable since I did not sumbit it to GitHub)
 - [2021](https://github.com/club-code/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Kotlin/khatharsis)
 - [2022](https://github.com/club-code/AdventOfCode2022/tree/main/Kotlin/khatharsis)
 - 2023 (coming soon)

I'm the former maintainer of a [localhost jukebox application written in Python](https://gitlab.com/club-jeux-int/jukebox-ultra-nrv), and the [club portal](https://github.com/khatharsis42/portail-cj-mk2), but I still maintain them on my spare time.
