# Bio
Hi ! I'm Khâtharsis, real name Hadrien Guelque.
Currently studying at TélécomSudParis Engineering School, I'd like to work in software engineering.

# Languages
I used to code a lot in Python, but now I'm mostly about Kotlin, sometimes Java. I'm still the official maintainer of one of my club's juekbox application, so it is my most active project right now.
I'm also coding a lot in C and C++, but those project aren't availables here. Trying to get into Rust.

# Experience
Head of teaching at my local coding student association, I'm the one making most of the formations.
I've been participating in Advent of Code each year since 2020. Here's where you can find my code for each year:
 - [2020](https://github.com/club-code/AdventOfCode2021)
 - [2021](https://github.com/club-code/AdventOfCode2021)

I'm the active maintainter of a [localhost jukebox application written in Python](https://github.com/khatharsis42/jukebox-ultra-nrv), and the [club portal](https://github.com/khatharsis42/portail-cj-mk2).
