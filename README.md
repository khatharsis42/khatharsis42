# Bio
Hi ! I'm Khâtharsis, real name unknown for now.
Currently a PhD student at Télécom - SudParis Engineering School, I'd like to work in software engineering.

# Languages
I used to code a lot in Python, but now I'm mostly about Kotlin, sometimes Java. I'm still the official maintainer of one of my club's juekbox application, so it is my most active project right now.
I'm also coding a lot in C and C++, but those project aren't availables here. Trying to get into Rust.
I have academic experience with Middleware tech in Java, High Performance computing with CUDA, OMP and MPI in C.

# Experience
Head of teaching at my local coding student association, I'm the one making most of the formations.
I've been participating in Advent of Code each year since 2020. Here's where you can find my code for each year:
 - 2020 (unavailable since I did not sumbit it to GitHub)
 - [2021](https://github.com/club-code/AdventOfCode2021/tree/main/Kotlin/khatharsis)
 - [2022](https://github.com/club-code/AdventOfCode2022/tree/main/Kotlin/khatharsis)


I'm the former maintainter of a [localhost jukebox application written in Python](https://gitlab.com/club-jeux-int/jukebox-ultra-nrv), and the [club portal](https://github.com/khatharsis42/portail-cj-mk2), but I still maintain them sometimes.
